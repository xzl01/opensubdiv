Description: high performance subdivision surface (subdiv) library - CPU runtime
 OpenSubdiv is a set of open source libraries that implement high
 performance subdivision surface (subdiv) evaluation on massively
 parallel CPU and GPU architectures. This codepath is optimized for
 drawing deforming subdivs with static topology at interactive
 framerates. The resulting limit surface matches Pixar's Renderman to
 numerical precision.
 .
 This package provides the CPU-based runtime library.
